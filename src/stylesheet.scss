/* Small Victories Sprockets File
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory and your sass directory
 * can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 * Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
 * about supported directives.
